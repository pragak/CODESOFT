## Introduction

During my internship at Codsoft, I developed and refined three distinct projects using Python. These projects were designed to address specific needs and provide practical solutions while showcasing my programming skills.

## Projects

### Password Generator

A command-line tool for generating secure, random passwords. This project includes features for specifying password length and complexity, ensuring the generated passwords meet various security standards.

- **Features**:
  - Customizable password length
  - Options to include uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols
  - Simple command-line interface

- **Directory**: `password_generator`

### To-Do List Application

A command-line application for managing tasks and to-dos. This project allows users to add, view, and delete tasks, providing a straightforward way to track and manage daily activities.

- **Features**:
  - Add, view, and delete tasks
  - Mark tasks as completed
  - Persistent storage using text files

- **Directory**: `to_do_list`

### Calculator

A basic command-line calculator that performs fundamental arithmetic operations. This project demonstrates Python's capabilities for handling user input and performing calculations.

- **Features**:
  - Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
  - Error handling for invalid input
  - Clear and reset functionalities

- **Directory**: `calculator`

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python (3.x)
- **Libraries**: Standard Python libraries (e.g., `os`, `sys`, `json` for file handling)

## Installation

To run any of the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codsoft-internship-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd codsoft-internship-projects/ProjectName
   ```

3. Each project is self-contained and does not require additional installation steps beyond Python. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Usage

Each project directory contains a `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to run and use the application. Generally, you can execute the main script file directly from the command line:

```bash
python main.py
```

Replace `main.py` with the relevant script name for the project you wish to run.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to enhance or improve these projects, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Be sure to follow the coding standards and guidelines outlined in the contributing documentation.
